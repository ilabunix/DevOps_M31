Why Use a Single Pane View with Sub-Dashboards in Grafana?

When designing Grafana dashboards, a Single Pane of Glass (SPOG) dashboard combined with sub-dashboards creates an efficient monitoring, troubleshooting, and decision-making system. This approach is a best practice because it balances visibility, usability, and performance.

🔹 The Role of a Single Pane View (SPOG)

A Single Pane View (or Main Dashboard) serves as the central hub where critical information is aggregated in one place.

✅ Key Benefits:
	1.	High-Level Overview:
	•	Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) across multiple resources (e.g., Compute, Storage, Network, Databases).
	•	Helps executives, managers, and engineers assess overall system health at a glance.
	2.	Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts:
	•	Shows active alerts, error rates, and anomalies in a consolidated view.
	•	Ensures that teams immediately identify issues across multiple services.
	3.	Reduced Cognitive Load:
	•	Users don’t have to switch between multiple dashboards.
	•	Improves efficiency and response times during incidents.
	4.	Better Performance (Avoids Overloading Queries):
	•	Instead of running heavy, detailed queries on a single dashboard, SPOG keeps queries lightweight and aggregated.
	•	Helps avoid slow performance in Grafana.
	5.	Central Navigation Hub:
	•	Users can click on sections to explore more details in sub-dashboards.

🔹 The Role of Sub-Dashboards

Sub-dashboards are dedicated, focused dashboards that provide detailed insights into specific AWS services or infrastructure components.

✅ Key Benefits:
	1.	Deeper Analysis of Specific Components:
	•	Each sub-dashboard focuses on one aspect, such as:
	•	EC2 Performance
	•	API Gateway Metrics
	•	RDS Query Performance
	•	VPC Network Traffic
	•	Engineers can quickly zoom in on problem areas.
	2.	Improved Performance & Load Distribution:
	•	Instead of overloading the main dashboard with complex queries, each sub-dashboard handles specific, detailed queries.
	•	Ensures Grafana remains responsive.
	3.	Team-Based Access & Permissions:
	•	Different teams (e.g., Ops, DevOps, SREs) may have their own customized sub-dashboards.
	•	Permissions can be set so users only access relevant dashboards.
	4.	Better Troubleshooting Workflow:
	•	When an issue is detected on the Single Pane View, engineers can click on a section to open the relevant sub-dashboard and investigate further.
	•	Example Flow:
	•	Main Dashboard Alert: “High API Gateway Latency 🚨”
	•	Click on API Gateway → Opens API GW Sub-Dashboard
	•	View detailed breakdown: latency per endpoint, error rates, throttling metrics.

🔹 How This Approach Helps Different Users
User Type
How It Helps Them
Executives & Managers
Get a high-level view of AWS infrastructure health without needing technical details.
DevOps & SREs
Quickly detect anomalies in the main dashboard and drill down into sub-dashboards for investigation.
Application Teams
View service-specific performance (e.g., API Gateway latency, DB slow queries) without being overwhelmed by all metrics.
Security & Compliance Teams
Monitor audit logs, network security, IAM roles in dedicated sub-dashboards.

🔹 Real-World Example: AWS Monitoring in Grafana

Imagine you’re monitoring AWS infrastructure, and you implement the following structure:

1️⃣ Main Dashboard (Single Pane View)
	•	AWS Infrastructure Overview
	•	Summary of EC2, RDS, API Gateway, VPC, S3
	•	Live alerts & incidents
	•	Click on any section to go to the sub-dashboard

2️⃣ Sub-Dashboards:
	•	EC2 Performance Dashboard → CPU, Memory, Disk, Instance Status
	•	RDS Query Performance → Slow queries, DB connections, Storage
	•	API Gateway Monitoring → Latency, 4xx/5xx Errors, Throttling
	•	VPC Traffic Dashboard → Ingress/Egress Traffic, Packet Loss, Latency

🔹 Scenario:
	•	The Main Dashboard shows “EC2 CPU Usage Critical 🚨”
	•	Click on EC2 Performance Dashboard
	•	View which instance is overloaded and take action!

⸻

🔹 Summary: Why Use This Approach?

✅ Faster Incident Response → Identify issues quickly and drill down.
✅ Better Performance & Usability → Main dashboard stays lightweight; sub-dashboards handle detailed queries.
✅ Custom Access Control → Different teams can have their own views while still using the same system.
✅ Scalability → As infrastructure grows, new sub-dashboards can be added without overwhelming the main one.
